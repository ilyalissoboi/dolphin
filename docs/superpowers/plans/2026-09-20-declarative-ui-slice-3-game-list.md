# Declarative UI Slice 3: Game Library

**Status:** In progress

**Goal:** Move the game-library shell into a Qt Designer form and add compact, always-available
view and filtering controls while preserving the existing list, grid, menu, launch, and empty
library behavior.

## Task 1: Migrate the existing shell

- [x] Add `GameListWidget.ui` for the view stack and current search controls.
- [x] Convert `GameList` from a `QStackedWidget` into the form's controller.
- [x] Remove the separate C++-authored `SearchBar` layout.
- [x] Preserve `Ctrl+F`, Escape, Close, search filtering, and the empty-library double-click action.
- [x] Add a Qt form test and verify the behavior-preserving migration.

## Task 2: Add the library control row

- [x] Keep search visible and make `Ctrl+F` focus and select it.
- [x] Add accessible List and Grid buttons synchronized with the View menu.
- [x] Add transient platform and region quick filters without replacing the existing multi-select
  View menu filters.
- [x] Add a grid-scale slider synchronized with the existing zoom shortcuts and saved scale.
- [x] Keep fixed view controls visible while search and filter fields compress at narrow widths.

## Task 3: Preserve compatibility

- [x] Keep saved preferred-view, grid-scale, table-header, and column-visibility settings.
- [x] Keep all existing platform and country visibility config keys in the filtering path.
- [x] Record the `.pot` msgid diff and retain moved search strings.
- [x] Keep list/grid selection, sorting, context menus, keyboard launch, and game-count updates.

## Task 4: Verify the slice

- [x] Build `dolphin-emu`, `qt-tests`, and `tests` on macOS.
- [x] Review light and dark list, grid, empty, filtered, and narrow-window states on macOS.
- [ ] Build and run both test binaries on Windows.
- [ ] Review light and dark controls, keyboard traversal, focus, and narrow-window behavior on
  Windows.

## Verification notes

- macOS built `dolphin-emu` and `qt-tests`; `qt-tests` passed all 99 tests, and `tests`
  passed 1183 tests with the same two environment-dependent shader tests skipped.
- The UI extraction regression suite passed.
- Light and Dark themes were reviewed with empty, populated list, populated grid, and filtered
  libraries. `Ctrl+F`, Escape, View-menu synchronization, direct view buttons, and zoom shortcut
  synchronization were exercised. The form test also lays out the row at 360 pixels and keeps both
  32-pixel view buttons and the 80-pixel scale control intact.
- Compared with the form-migration checkpoint, `Search games...` remains in extraction and
  `Close` is removed. The new control labels, accessibility names, platform names, and region names
  are extracted.

## Definition of done

- [x] `GameListWidget.ui` owns the game-library layout.
- [x] Search, platform, and region controls are always available.
- [x] View buttons, View menu actions, slider, and zoom shortcuts stay synchronized.
- [x] Existing saved settings and multi-select menu filters retain their meaning.
- [ ] macOS and Windows builds, tests, gettext checks, and visual review pass.
