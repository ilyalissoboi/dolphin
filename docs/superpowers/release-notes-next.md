previous fork releases and remain in its history.

## Big Picture game options

- Open a game's options from the library with the new **Game Options** menu button (X on
  Xbox-style controllers by default), **F6**, or a right-click on its card. Right-click
  previously opened Library Options, which stays on R1/F3.
- **Start Game**, including the disc choice for grouped multi-disc games.
- **Load State** lists that game's ten save-state slots, with previews, without starting it,
  and boots the game from the chosen slot. Hardcore mode, NetPlay and movie playback block it,
  as they block loading in a running game.
- **Game Properties** edits that game's settings without starting it. Executables without a
  game ID have no per-game settings.
- **Reset Play Time** asks first, with Cancel selected.
- Menu-control configurations from earlier releases have no Game Options binding. Bind it in
  **Settings → Controllers → Big Picture Menu Controls → Mapping**, or use F6.

## Big Picture settings

- Path settings open a **Choose Folder** or **Choose File** browser inside the settings menu,
  starting at the current value. Folder settings list folders only; choices are stored with
  native separators, as the desktop path pickers store them. **Enter Path** remains for typing.
- Volume no longer lists 101 rows. On a number setting's options page, Left and Right step the
  value (with key repeat) within its allowed range; the shoulder buttons still change category.

## Big Picture game folders

- **Library Options → Game Folders** lists the configured folders, with Add Game Folder,
  Scan Subfolders and Refresh. Selecting a folder asks to remove it from the library; no files
  are deleted. Folder changes made in desktop settings appear while Big Picture is open.
- Subfolder scanning remains one setting for all folders.

## Big Picture controller mapping

- **Settings → Controllers → (controller) → Mapping** lists every input with its current
  binding. Select one and press a button, key, stick direction or trigger to bind it; with no
  input for a few seconds, the binding is unchanged. Row options offer **Bind New Input** and
  **Clear Binding**; **Default Mapping** restores Dolphin's defaults after confirmation.
- While waiting for an input, the menu ignores controller input, including Back and the Open
  Menu binding, so those buttons can be bound too.
- Wii Remotes offer the attached **Extension** (Nunchuk, Classic Controller and others) and
  its inputs, plus **Attach MotionPlus**.
- Stick, trigger, rumble and option settings, such as dead zone, range, and sideways or
  upright Wii Remote, can be tuned on the mapping page. Settings driven by input expressions
  stay read-only.
- **Save as profile** names the current mapping with the on-screen keyboard and saves it to
  the user profile folder, like the desktop profile box.
- **Big Picture Menu Controls** is now in the controller list, so the menu's own bindings can
  be mapped, tuned and saved without the desktop. Keyboard navigation remains available.
- Mapping applies globally and, like device and profile changes, is unavailable while a game
  runs, during NetPlay or during movies. Motion-sensor passthrough, calibration and controller
  types remain in desktop settings.

## Big Picture performance

- Menu pages are no longer rebuilt every frame; large libraries no longer allocate per game on
  each frame.
- Settings and library state are shared between updates instead of being rebuilt or copied
  for each change, decoded cover, or folder listing.
- Covers are kept across play-time, title, tag and scan updates and are reloaded only when a
  game's artwork changes or a game leaves and returns to the library. The cover caches hold
  64 covers, with a 64 MiB limit for decoded artwork.
